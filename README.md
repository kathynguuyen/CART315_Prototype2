# CART315_Prototype2
 
For this prototype I wanted to make a shooting and searching for an item type of game. I used assets from the store to create a city landscape where you play as a player and you have to defeat the slimes and collect flowers. I explored a lot of assets in this prototype and I also used the collector script in order to collect flowers.


# Playtest questions

1. Is the envrionment too foggy, is it hard to see?
2. How can I make the game a bit harder or is it okay this way?
3. Should the slimes be an obstacle to collect the flowers or it should be 2 different missions? 
4. Comments and suggestions?

# Feedback

I realized that the game is quite simple and I think the monsters should sort of attack you to add more challenge to the game. In a way I should make the slimes make it more difficult to collect the flowers. The whole ambience of the game is also a bit too bright. I also had to add clearer instructions. The scaling of the player should also be proportional to the environement.
