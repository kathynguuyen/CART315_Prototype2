# CART315_Prototype2
 
For this prototype I wanted to make a shooting and searching for an item type of game. I used assets from the store to create a city landscape where you play as a player and you have to defeat the slimes and collect flowers. I explored a lot of assets in this prototype and I also used the collector script in order to collect flowers.


# Playtest questions

1. Is the envrionment too foggy, is it hard to see?
2. How can I make the game a bit harder or is it okay this way?
3. Should the slimes be an obstacle to collect the flowers or it should be 2 different missions? 
4. Comments and suggestions?
